                The house's reputation for being haunted has caused it to become "an avoided house," and although the
                narrator decides to rent it for six months (from October to March) and live there with his spinster
                sister (Patty), they cannot retain any servants due to a plethora of bizarre house noises. Therefore,
                by mid-November, Patty suggests that she and John "take the house wholly and solely into our own hands"
                and live without servants, with the exception of Bottles the stable-man who is deaf and therefore not
                bothered by the haunted noises. Patty further suggests that they invite a group of friends to come down
                and form a "Society" that would occupy the house for three months and "see what happens" as far as supern.
